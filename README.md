#  Dual-Screen PDF Viewer for latex-beamer

This is a simple viewer for latex-beamer presentations that are built
with the **show notes on second screen** option of latex-beamer.

It will take your PDF file, split it in a left and right half and
render the two halves individually to the screens.

## Usage
There is a manpage included that explains all the options and keybindings. Most important ones are probably:

Command line:

dspdfviewer [options] *pdf-file*

where the most useful option is probably -f, because it enables you to use the software with a standard pdf (i.e. not specifically built for latex-beamer).

In-Program-Controls:

Left/Right, Mouse Buttons or Mouse Wheel: Back/Forward

S or F12: Swap screens (if you see the wall clock on the projector)

B or . (period): blank/unblank audience screen

Q/Esc: Quit

## Installation from binaries
### Debian wheezy/jessie/sid
If you are using Debian wheezy, jessie or sid, you should be able to
get a binary from my repository:

http://danny-edel.de/deb/

If you open the link with a web browser, there are some copy-and-paste
instructions on how to add the repository. These packages are built by myself.

### Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) or newer

For Ubuntu, there are two PPAs configured:
A "daily" repository and a "release" repository. Use the daily builds only
if you want to help in development (test bugs in the latest git revision),
otherwise stick to the "release" PPA:

1. Daily
   https://launchpad.net/~dannyedel/+archive/dspdfviewer-daily
2. Release
   https://launchpad.net/~dannyedel/+archive/dspdfviewer

### Arch Linux
In the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) there is
a PKGBUILD for installing dspdfviewer from
[latest release](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dspdfviewer/) or from
[git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dspdfviewer-git/).

### Windows
Use the application provided in bin directory. It was build using Visual Studio
2010 Express, Boost 1.58.0, Poppler 0.22.0 and QT 4.8.6. Some of the required
DLLs come from the GnuWin32 project.


## Installing from source

### Debian-based systems
You need the "devscripts" debian package installed to build from source.

Note: Depending on your system, you must either use
`su -c 'command --arguments'` or `sudo command --arguments`
to run a command as root.

1. (once)
   `git clone git://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer.git`
2. (update)
   `cd dspdfviewer; git pull`
3. (install build dependencies, **as root**)
   `mk-build-deps --install --remove`
4. (build)
   `debuild -tc`
5. (install, **as root**)
   `debi`

### Other systems
You will need a C++11 compiler and the cmake build system.

1. (once)
   git clone git://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer.git
2. (update)
   cd dspdfviewer; git pull
3. (make a build directory)
   mkdir /path/to/builddir ; cd /path/to/builddir
4. (create Makefile)
   cmake /path/to/sourcedir
   (*note: this step should tell you about missing build-deps*)
5. (build)
   make
6. (install)
   make install
   (optional)

### MacPorts
If you use a mac with macports, it is very easy to set up a qt4 environment

1. install macports
2. port install poppler +qt4+quartz
3. port install cmake

then follow the normal build instructions

### Windows
Building should be possible with lots of compilers. For Visual C++ 2010, first
ensure you have built Boost and Poppler and installed Qt 4 and CMake.

1. (once)
   git clone https://github.com/projekter/dspdfviewer.git
   Clone this fork, as it contains some changes that are necessary to support
   VC++2010's "special skills" (ie lacking C++11 support).
2. (update)
   cd dspdfviewer; git pull
3. cd build; cmake ..
4. Open CMakeCache.txt and adjust the variables Boost_INCLUDE_DIR,
   Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE and Boost_PROGRAM_OPTIONS_LIBRARY_RELEASE and
   POPPLER_LIBRARY to point to the correct paths on your system.
5. cmake ..
6. Open dspdfviewer.sln in Visual Studio and build the solution.
