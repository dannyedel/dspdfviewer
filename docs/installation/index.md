You can choose if you want to install the bleeding-edge development version
(may eat your firstborn, plain out crash, or do other unexpected things) or the
last stable release.

* [stable version]
* [current development (git)]

When you compile from source, you have a few choices that may affect the build.
Please read [compile options and dependencies][compile options] carefully,
especially if you're building a package for a wider audience.

[stable version]: /installation/source/stable.html
[current development (git)]: /installation/source/git.html
[compile options]: /installation/source/options.html
