<h2>Presenter remote controls</h2>

<p>Most (maybe not all) presenter remote controls technically act as a keyboard sending one of the keystrokes listed either in the main or additional keybindings. If your remote control does not work as intended, please file a bug report describing what keystrokes it generates when you press its buttons. If there is no conflict, a keybinding will be included in the next release.</p>
