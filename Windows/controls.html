<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>You can use the following controls while <b>dspdfviewer</b> is running.</p>

<p>Note that mouse-clicks are subject to pointer position if the hyperlink support is enabled. If your mouse cursor changes to a hand, it will follow the link you are hovering on a click.

<table>
   <colgroup>
      <col width="260">
      <col>
   </colgroup>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: ?, F1</b></td>
      <td><p>Display quick-help (most important key bindings)</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: Spacebar, Page Down / <br>Mouse: Left-Click, Wheel Down</b></td>
      <td><p>Go one page forward</p>
          <p>Additional keyboard aliases: Down, Right, Return, Enter, N, F</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: Backspace, Page Up / <br>Mouse: Right-Click, Wheel Up</b></td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: G</b></td>
      <td><p>Go to specific page (a number entry window will pop up)</p>
          <p>Note that the this counts PDF pages, so a single slide having 6 unmasking steps will be 7 PDF pages long, including the initial near-blank page.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: Home, H</b></td>
      <td><p>Go to the first page and reset the clocks to zero.</p></td>
          <p>Use this if you want the clocks to stop at zero, use the G (goto) function to page 1 if you want to them to keep running.</p>
          <p>Note that the Home key may be called &quot;Pos 1&quot; on some keyboards.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: Escape, Q</b></td>
      <td><p>Quit <b>dspdfviewer</b>.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: S, F12</b></td>
      <td><p>Switch primary and secondary screens</p>
          <p>Use this if the audience sees your &rsquo;note&rsquo; side with the clocks and you see the actual presentation on your screen.</p>
          <p>If you just want to see the main presentation (for example, because the projector is behind you), use <b>T</b>.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: T</b></td>
      <td><p>Switch secondary screen&rsquo;s function</p>
          <p>Use this if you want to see the audience side on your screen, without showing the notes to the audience. Pressing the button again will switch back to normal operation.</p></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><b>Keyboard: D</b></td>
      <td><p>Switch duplication of the audience&rsquo;s screen</p>
          <p>Use this if you want to see the audience side and the notes on your screen (so the full presentation), leaving the audience&rsquo;s screen untouched. Pressing the button again will switch back to split mode.</p></td>
