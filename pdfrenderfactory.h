/** Factory for rendered pages
 *
 * This class is responsible for rendering the PDF to images.
 *
 * You create a factory using a filename (if the file cannot be opened this will throw),
 * then you can simply request renderings by supplying the desired size and page part
 * to requestPageRendering.
 *
 * The class uses the global instance of QThreadPool and renders in paralell, meaning it
 * can take advantage of SMP or Multi-Core Systems.
 *
 * NOTE for updating the external file:
 * If you plan on rewriting the displayed file while this application is running,
 * you can cache the entire file to memory. This can be done via constructor parameter.
 *
 * That way, if you create an invalid PDF file (for example you make an error in your latex
 * document), it still has a copy of the old file present.
 * The tradeoff is that this will cost you additional memory for *the entire PDF file*, which
 * can be a lot if you have an image-heavy PDF file.
 *
 * The class will notify you via signals when it detects a file change. Then it will try to re-read
 * the file, and it will notify you if that has succeeded or failed.
 *
 * If the re-reading failed, you can still get pages from cache, and you can keep rendering new ones
 * if you have used the memory cache. However, if you try to render new pages, you will probably
 * experience strange behaviour or the program will crash.
 *
 * If the re-reading went well, the cache will be cleared and new page renders will use the new pdf
 * file.
 *
