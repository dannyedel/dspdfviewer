How to install the dspdfviewer
==============================



System-specific installation instructions
-----------------------------------------

Please refer to the project's website for installation instructions,
broken down by operating system.

At least for Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Arch, MacOS and Windows the website
contains specific installation instructions. For some systems,
ready-made binaries are provided.

Installation from source (generic cmake)
----------------------------------------
dspdfviewer requires the following build-time dependencies:
  * cmake
  * boost
  * qt5
  * poppler-qt5

From inside the source directory, execute the following steps:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
(as root) make install

Note that there is no make uninstall, so please redirect the make install
step through your system's package management utility. The
"cmake" step will respect --prefix= parameters, and "make install"
will respect DESTDIR.
